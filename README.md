- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @mariellauriga
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in using my coding and research experience to build a more sustainable world.
- ğŸŒ± The codes here have been used for my own research and in some cases are not the last version. 
If you find that some of them are useful for your issues and need more details on the algorithm, contact me.
