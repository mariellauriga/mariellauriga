- 👋 Hi, I’m @mariellauriga
- 👀 I’m interested in researching and coding to develop a more sustainable world.
- 🌱 Please note that the codes here have been used for my own research and in some cases are not the last version. 
If you find that some of them are useful for your issues and need more details on the algorithm, please contact me. 
I will be happy to explain them to you.

From now I will make an effort to better comments on my codes and share them with the community.
